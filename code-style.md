# 1. Naming Convention


## 1.1. File Naming
In this article we'll look into naming some project files such as classes, drawables, layouts etc.

### 1.1.1. Classes
- We are using [Upper Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). Such as: ``ProductDetail.kt``
- Android component class names should end with component names. Such as: ``ProductDetailActivity`` or ``ChangeUserNameDialog``
- Special and numeric characters should not use in class names.
